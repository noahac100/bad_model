# bad_model
The model performs an analysis to assess the influence of various features, particularly pollution levels and average temperatures, on the standard yield of crops on a farm. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code's key components:

1. Imports: Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are imported for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
2. Logging Configuration: The logging setup allows for tracking the execution flow and debugging.
3. Configuration Parameters: A dictionary holds various parameters, including an SQL query to fetch data from a SQLite database and paths for additional CSV files. Regex patterns are also defined for extracting specific values.
4. Data Processing: An instance of `FieldDataProcessor` is used to process the data from the database, resulting in a DataFrame (`field_df`). Unnecessary columns are dropped, creating a refined dataset for analysis.
5. Scatter Plot: A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between average temperatures (`Ave_temps`) and the standard yield (`Standard_yield`), allowing for initial visual assessment.
6. Correlation Calculation: The `get_correlation` function calculates and prints the Pearson correlation coefficient between `Ave_temps` and `Standard_yield`, indicating the strength and direction of their linear relationship.
7. Linear Regression Model: The `fit_linear_regression_model` function fits a linear regression model using pollution levels to predict standard yield, returning the fitted model, predictions, and actual yield values.
8. Model Output: Finally, the model, predictions, and actual yield values are printed to the console.

# Limitations of the Model

Despite the structured approach, the model's performance is limited, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics obtained:
- R-squared (0.08): This indicates that only about 8% of the variance in `Standard_yield` can be explained by the model. This low value suggests that the model does not capture the underlying relationships effectively, leading to poor predictive power.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): An MAE of 0.0879 signifies that the model's predictions deviate from actual values by about 8.79% on average, which can be considered relatively high depending on the scale of the target variable.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The MSE and RMSE values (0.0123 and 0.1107, respectively) also reflect significant prediction errors, indicating that the model struggles to predict the standard yield accurately.

# Conclusion

These evaluation metrics reveal that the linear regression model may not be an adequate fit for the data. The low explanatory power and relatively high error rates suggest that other factors influencing standard yield may not be captured, or the relationship may be non-linear. Further exploration with more complex models, additional features, or refined data preprocessing may be necessary to improve predictive performance. The model was created to illustrate the importance of model complexity and how it affects accuracy.
